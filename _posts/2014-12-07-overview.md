### Basics

[PieceMeta.com](http://piecemeta.com) is a platform for sharing and collaborating on dance related sensor and analysis data.

It was conceived by [Anton Koch](https://github.com/dasantonym) at the [Choreographic Coding Lab](http://choreographiccoding.org/) 2013 in Frankfurt, Germany. The name and concept are inspired by [Piecemaker](http://motionbank.org/de/event/pm2go-video-annotation-leicht-gemacht) by [MotionBank](http://motionbank.org/).

The PieceMeta API is designed as a [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) storage for archiving data in Packages consisting of multiple Channels with bundled Streams and making it universally accessible.

#### Packages

A [Package](#/get-channel) represents a "Data Event" of a certain duration (a continuous Piece of Movement) in which constant Streams of continuous and regularly distributed sample points (frames with a target frame rate) are bundled in Channels.

Packages can be created in reference to an existing one to extend the existing data (e.g. analysing the existing streams and providing new interpretated data). See [creating Packages](#/post-package) for more information.

#### Channels

The [Channel](#/get-channel) is a hierarchical wrapper for one or more data Streams representing properties belonging to a specific member of the data analysis (e.g. a Head with it's position and rotation values).

#### Streams

A [Stream](#/get-stream) represents a single value property with frames of data values in an array of float numbers together with a desired frame rate in **fps** as a float number.

Streams can be grouped together to represent multidimensional values. See how to [create Streams](#/post-stream) for more information.

#### Example object hierarchy

    - Package title: "Motion Capture"
        - Channel title: "Hips"
            - Stream group: "position", title: "x"
            - Stream group: "position", title: "y"
            - Stream group: "position", title: "z"
            - Stream group: "rotation", title: "x"
            - Stream group: "rotation", title: "y"
            - Stream group: "rotation", title: "z"
        - Channel title: "Head", parent_channel: "Hips"
            - Stream group: "position", title: "x"
            - Stream group: "position", title: "y"
            - Stream group: "position", title: "z"
            - Stream group: "rotation", title: "x"
            - Stream group: "rotation", title: "y"
            - Stream group: "rotation", title: "z"

#### Data transport

The API supports various [formats for object serialization](#/serialization).

You can also fetch bundled [Packages](#/export-package) and [Channels](#/export-channel) with additional CSV format support.
