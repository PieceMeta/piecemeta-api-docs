The PieceMeta API is a CRUD based data storage for data [Packages](#/get-package) consisting of multiple [Channels](#/get-package).

Channels represent hierarchical wrappers for one or more data Streams to be able to represent multiple properties belonging to a specific member of the data analysis (e.g. a Head with it's position and rotation values).

The Streams contain frames of data values represented by an array of float numbers and are presented together with a desired frame rate in **fps** as a float number.

Streams can be grouped together to represent multidimensional values. See how to [create Streams](#/post-streams) for more information.

To allow for more precise selection of requested data one can first get the Channels for a specific Package, then decide which data to fetch and then get the Streams.

#### Example object hierarchy

    - Package title: "Motion Capture"
        - Channel title: "Hips"
            - Stream group: "position", title: "x"
            - Stream group: "position", title: "y"
            - Stream group: "position", title: "z"
            - Stream group: "rotation", title: "x"
            - Stream group: "rotation", title: "y"
            - Stream group: "rotation", title: "z"
        - Channel title: "Head", parent_channel: "Hips"
            - Stream group: "position", title: "x"
            - Stream group: "position", title: "y"
            - Stream group: "position", title: "z"
            - Stream group: "rotation", title: "x"
            - Stream group: "rotation", title: "y"
            - Stream group: "rotation", title: "z"
